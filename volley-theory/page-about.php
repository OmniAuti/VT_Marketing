				<h1 class="hero--text">What coaches need right now</h1>
				<p class="section--text">is insights that save time and win games. My teams have always needed a leg up before the whistle blows and none more desperately than my college teams. Once I made the jump to the college game, the infinite amount of time I had to get that leg up was abruptly zero. Thatâ€™s when I started to consider how I could produce this critical information that had made my teams so successful at the high school and club level with as little time invested as possible. After a mountain of work and years of sharpening, VolleyTheory is ready to bring coaches, at all levels, the clarity they need to position their teams to win.</p>
